# Markdown Docs Translation Tracker.

## About.

A simple tool to keep tracking of translation of documentation written in Markdown. It uses [franc](https://github.com/wooorm/franc) as a library to detect languages on files and [iso-639-3](https://github.com/wooorm/iso-639-3) to get each language in a human-readable format.

## Why?

The idea behind this project is to have an automated tool that can keep track of which files are translated or not in a repository that contains documentation written in Markdown. This way, translation becomes a little bit easier. From the main Readme, the team can see file list and probable language of each file. The table also provides direct access to each file by creating a link to it and placing it into the table.

## Features.

- Recursively explore directories to detect the language for each file.
- File Inclusion and Exclusion.
- Directory Inclusion and Exclusion.
- File Format (Extension) Inclusion and Exclusion.
- Exclude languages from being detected.
- Markdown Table generation with links to files in the repository.
- Sorting languages in table. For example, place all English files at the top.
- Text exclusion. For example, exclude English content that should not be translated (as some code).

## Planned Features.

- Show words percentage on each detected language.

## Getting Started.

1. Install dependencies.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. Copy configuration file from `config.json.example`.

    On Linux/OSX/WSL:
    ```bash
    cp config.json.example config.json
    ```

    On Windows:
    ```bash
    copy config.json.example config.json
    ```

3. Adapt the `config.json` file to your project.

    By default, the configuration is read from `config.json` file. Only **required** parameters are needed to start using the tool, but the **optional** ones provide better options to fit your project. Here's a list of the current parameters that can be used:

    - **Required** Parameters:

        - `docsRootPath (string)`: The root path of your documentation project in your local environment. **Note**: If you're on Windows and not using [WSL](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL), please verify the path you provide is in Windows format as the example is provided with a Linux path.

        - `repositoryRootPath (string)`: The root path of the documentation in the repository. **Note**: If you're on Windows and not using [WSL](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL), please verify the path you provide is in Windows format as the example is provided with a Linux path.

    - **Optional** Parameters:

        - `recursive (boolean)`: Whether or not to search files in directories recursively.  

        - `directoriesToExclude (Array)`: Which directories to exclude when searching files.

        - `filesToExclude (Array)`: Which files to exclude from the search. **Note**: These must have the dot before the file extension, for example `.css`.

        - `fileFormatsToExclude (Array)`: Which file formats to exclude when searching files. **Note**: These must have the dot before the file extension, for example `.json`.

        - `onlyFileFormats (Array)`: Only include these file formats when searching files. **Note**: These must have the dot before the file extension, for example `.md`.

        - `onlyLanguages (Array)`: Only include these languages when making prediction of the language on files. **Note**: These must be in [ISO-639-3](https://github.com/wooorm/iso-639-3/blob/main/to-1.json) format (three letter code).

        - `languagesToExclude (Array)`: Which languages to exclude when making prediction of the language on files. **Note**: These must be in [ISO-639-3](https://github.com/wooorm/iso-639-3/blob/main/to-1.json) format (three letter code).

        - `limitResultsTo (Number)`: Limit languages results.

        - `defaultTableHeader (string)`: Table header to use in the resulting table.

        - `tableFilenameDirectory (string)`: Directory to place the resulting Markdown file. **Note**: If you're on Windows and not using [WSL](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL), please verify the path you provide is in Windows format as the example is provided with a Linux path.

        - `tableFilename (string)`: Filename of the resulting Markdown file.

        - `sortFirstLanguage (string | null)`: Which language to place at the top of the table. **Note**: This must be in [ISO-639-3](https://github.com/wooorm/iso-639-3/blob/main/to-1.json) format (three letter code).

        - `desiredLanguage (string | null)`: Which language is the target language for translations. This is to place an emoji so translated and pending for translation files can be easily seen. For example, if your documentation is in English (eng) and needs to be translated to Spanish (spa), this parameter should be set to "spa" (Spanish). **Note**: This must be in [ISO-639-3](https://github.com/wooorm/iso-639-3/blob/main/to-1.json) format (three letter code).
        
        - `excludeWords (Array)`: An Array containing which words to exclude from text analysis. For example, you could exclude some code that need to remain in English in Markdown files.

    For default values, please check [config.json.example](config.json.example) file.

4. Run.

    After configuring the tool, you can run it using the following command:

    On Linux/OSX/WSL:
    ```bash
    node src/main.js
    ```

    On Windows:
    ```bash
    cd src
    node main.js
    ```

    It should generate a Markdown file with a table. For example, the following is an example table generated using part of the [Vue Docs Next](https://github.com/vuejs/docs-next) documentation:

    | Filename | Language
    |---|---|
    |[README.md](src/.vuepress/theme/README.md)|English :x:|
    |[README.md](src/README.md)|Spanish :heavy_check_mark:|
    |[application-api.md](src/api/application-api.md)|English :x:|
    |[application-config.md](src/api/application-config.md)|English :x:|
    |[basic-reactivity.md](src/api/basic-reactivity.md)|English :x:|
    |[built-in-components.md](src/api/built-in-components.md)|English :x:|
    |[composition-api.md](src/api/composition-api.md)|English :x:|
    |[computed-watch-api.md](src/api/computed-watch-api.md)|English :x:|

    This table provides direct access to each file in the repository and shows the most probable language for the contents of each file, according to [franc](https://github.com/wooorm/franc) library results.
